# WARNING
- The passwords are all in plaintext
- Look at the code, the passwords are all "Letmein123!"
- Certificate based authentication/encryption coming soon

# Details
- Provides a unified platform to ingest, parse, and visualize firewall logs
- Centralize multi-vendor logs
- Converts firewall syslog into the ECS (Elastic Common Schema) with Logstash
- Docker-Compose: Spins up a single node cluster of Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- Password Based X-Pack Security (The password is Letmein123!)

# Who should use this?
- Homelabbers who want a simple functioning ELK stack
- Enterprises looking to test out the ELK stack
- Enterprises looking to not pay by the GB for fancy SIEMs (Bad idea)
- Employees who want to show upper management cool dashboards during their performance review

# How do I run this?
